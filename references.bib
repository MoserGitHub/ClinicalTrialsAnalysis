These designs possess good frequentist properties and allow early termination of the trial when the interim data indicate that the experimental regimen is inefficacious. The rigid study design, however, can be difficult to follow exactly because the response has to be evaluated at prespecified fixed number of patients.</p>},

@article{Dmitrienko2006,
   abstract = {<p>This paper reviews Bayesian strategies for monitoring clinical trial data. It focuses on a Bayesian stochastic curtailment method based on the predictive probability of observing a clinically significant outcome at the scheduled end of the study given the observed data. The proposed method is applied to derive efficacy and futility stopping rules in clinical trials with continuous, normally distributed and binary endpoints. The sensitivity of the resulting stopping rules to the choice of prior distributions is examined and guidelines for choosing a prior distribution of the treatment effect are discussed. The Bayesian predictive approach is compared to the frequentist (conditional power) and mixed Bayesian‐frequentist (predictive power) approaches. The interim monitoring strategies discussed in the paper are illustrated using examples from a small proof‐of‐concept study and a large mortality trial.

abstract = {Bayesian analysis of a non-inferiority trial is advantageous in allowing direct probability statements to be made about the relative treatment difference rather than relying on an arbitrary and often poorly justified non-inferiority margin. When the primary analysis will be Bayesian, a Bayesian approach to sample size determination will often be appropriate for consistency with the analysis. We demonstrate three Bayesian approaches to choosing sample size for non-inferiority trials with binary outcomes and review their advantages and disadvantages. First, we present a predictive power approach for determining sample size using the probability that the trial will produce a convincing result in the final analysis. Next, we determine sample size by considering the expected posterior probability of non-inferiority in the trial. Finally, we demonstrate a precision-based approach. We apply these methods to a non-inferiority trial in antiretroviral therapy for treatment of HIV-infected children. A predictive power approach would be most accessible in practical settings, because it is analogous to the standard frequentist approach. Sample sizes are larger than with frequentist calculations unless an informative analysis prior is specified, because appropriate allowance is made for uncertainty in the assumed design parameters, ignored in frequentist calculations. An expected posterior probability approach will lead to a smaller sample size and is appropriate when the focus is on estimating posterior probability rather than on testing. A precision-based approach would be useful when sample size is restricted by limits on recruitment or costs, but it would be difficult to decide on sample size using this approach alone.},
